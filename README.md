# Discord Music
A lavalink based Discord Music bot, provides high quality music on your voice channels.

# Info
I've used erela.js as lavalink client to connect to lavalink server, in future erela.js can be updated so make sure you've install updated version of erela.js. For Discord client, used discord.js v13.3 development branch, you can use v13 previous versions. (Note: This bot doesn't made for support discord.js v12, make sure you've installed v13 along with nodejs v16+ and npm 7+ requirements.)

# How to install it
Simply clone the GitHub repository and after clone open terminal on that folder and type `npm i`, it should install all requirements which mentioned in package.json file. After installtion done, put your lavalink server "host / IP, port, password" to [nodes.json](https://github.com/Dacydl/Discord-Music/blob/main/json/nodes.json) file and run `node MelodyTune.js` (MelodyTune is owned by me, please don't give same name of your bot whenever you using this repo.)
